What is a File function in Python?

Keywords to create and write a file:

To create and write a file in Python, you can use the following keywords:

open(): This function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which to open the file. The mode can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, or 'a' for appending.
write(): This method is used to write to a file. It takes a string as an argument and writes it to the file.
close(): This method is used to close a file. It's a good practice to close a file after you're done with it to free up system resources.
